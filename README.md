## About Me

👋 I'm a passionate software engineer from Sri Lanka. I'm deeply immersed in the world of technology and open-source software, with a particular fondness for Linux and its various distributions. My journey in the tech realm has been both thrilling and fulfilling, and I'm here to share some of my interests and experiences.

🖥️ **Linux Enthusiast**: I have a strong affinity for Linux, and I specialize in configuring and optimizing Linux systems for various purposes. I'm particularly enthusiastic about NixOS (BTW, I use NixOS).

🎮 **Gamer at Heart**: When I'm not diving into the intricacies of software and Linux, you can often find me in the gaming world. Video games are my go-to for unwinding and having fun. Whether it's exploring virtual worlds or engaging in epic battles, gaming is a significant part of my life.

🌐 **Open Source Advocate**: I believe in the power of open source and actively contribute to and support open-source projects. I'm committed to giving back to the community that has enriched my knowledge and skills.

🔧 **Problem Solver**: As a software engineer, I'm dedicated to finding elegant solutions to complex problems. I enjoy tackling challenges, writing clean code, and making technology work seamlessly.

📚 **Lifelong Learner**: Technology is an ever-evolving field, and I'm constantly learning and adapting to stay at the cutting edge. I find joy in discovering new tools, languages, and frameworks.

😺 **Cat Lover**: I also have a soft spot for our feline friends. Cats are not just adorable but also a great source of comfort and companionship. I often find myself scrolling through cat videos during my breaks.

🌟 Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of code, Linux, gaming, and all things tech together. Feel free to reach out if you share my interests or have any questions. I'm always up for a good tech discussion or a multiplayer game!
